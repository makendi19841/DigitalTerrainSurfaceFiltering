# DigitalTerrainSurfaceFiltering
This project aims to implement an improved automated filtering method based on progressive TIN (triangulated irregular networks) densification to generate DTMs for steep mountainous areas and adjacent residential areas.

Digital terrain models (DTMs) are considered important basic geographic data. They are widely used in the fields of cartography, land utilization, urban planning, communications, and remote sensing. Digital photogrammetry mainly based on stereo image matching is a frequently applied technique to generate DTMs. Generally, the process of ground filtering should be applied to the point cloud derived from image matching to separate terrain and off-terrain points before DTM generation. However, many of the existing filtering methods perform unsatisfactorily for steep mountainous areas, particularly when residential neighborhoods exist in the proximity of the test areas.
